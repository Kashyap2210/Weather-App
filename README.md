# Weather App

This is a Weather App That I Have Made Using API.
THis showcases my ability to deal with API's and use them to make a project.

HTML,CSS are used for basic structure and styling of the page.
JavaScript is used to give the functionality to the app.

JavaScript Concepts that I Have Used in this Project are:

- API's
- Async Functions
- If-else statements
- Event Listeners

I Have also used the Terminal to upload this project on my Github.
